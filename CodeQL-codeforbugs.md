Help me write CodeQL code that will search C and C++ code lines that doesnâ€™t decrement a refcount (leaking a reference)

Sure, here is an example CodeQL query that can be used to search for C and C++ code lines that do not decrement a reference count and thus may leak a reference:

```
ql
Copy code
/**
 * @name Possible reference leak
 * @description Find function calls that increment the reference count but do not decrement it.
 * @kind problem
 * @problem.severity warning
 * @id cpp/possible-reference-leak
 */

import cpp

from FunctionCall fc, Function f, int offset
where
  // Find function calls to functions that increment the reference count
  exists(Callable c |
    c = fc.getTarget() and
    exists(FunctionCall cf |
      cf.getTarget() = c and
      c.getName() = "increment_refcount"
    )
  ) and
  // Find the function definition that contains the function call
  f = fc.getAncestorOfType(Function) and
  // Find the statement that contains the function call
  exists(Stmt s | s = fc.getAncestorOfType(Stmt)) and
  // Find the line number of the statement
  offset = s.getLocation().getStart().getLine() and
  // Make sure there is no decrement_refcount function call in the same function definition after the increment_refcount call
  not exists(Callable dc |
    dc.getName() = "decrement_refcount" and
    exists(FunctionCall df |
      df.getTarget() = dc and
      df.getAncestorOfType(Function) = f and
      df.getAncestorOfType(Stmt).getLocation().getStart().getLine() > offset
    )
  )
select fc, "Possible reference leak: " + fc.getTarget().getName() + " at line " + toString(offset)
```

This query looks for function calls that increment the reference count, but do not have a corresponding call that decrements the reference count. It does this by first looking for function calls to functions with the name "increment_refcount". It then finds the function definition that contains the function call, as well as the statement that contains the function call. It gets the line number of the statement and makes sure that there is no call to a function with the name "decrement_refcount" in the same function definition after the increment_refcount call.

The query returns a list of function calls that may be leaking a reference. The output includes the name of the function being called and the line number of the function call. Note that you may need to modify the query to match the specific function names and code structure of your C or C++ project.
